## Traits
A trait defines the functionality a particular type has and can share with other types. We can use traits to define shared behaviour in an abstract way. We can use triat bounds to specify that a generic type can be any type that has certain behaviour.

Note: Traits are similar to a feature often called `interfaces` in other languages, although with some differences.
