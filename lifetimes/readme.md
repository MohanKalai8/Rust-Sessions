## Generic lifetime parameters
Lifetimes in Rust are a way of ensuring that references are valid as long as they are needed, preventing dangling references. They are denoted using a syntax like `'a` and are used to specify how long a reference should be valid. Lifetimes are particularly important in functions and structs to ensure memory safety without needing a garbage collector. Rust's borrow checker uses lifetimes to enforce these rules at compile time, making sure that references do not outlive the data they point to.

## Three rules of lifetimes
The first rule applies to input lifetimes, and the second and third rules apply to output lifetimes.

1. The first rule is, if a function with one parameter gets one lifeteime parameter: `fn:foo<'a>(x:&'a i32);` a function with two parameters gets two separte lifeime parameters `fn foo<'a, 'b>(x: &'a i32, y: &'b i32) -> &'a i32` ; and so on.
2. The second rule is that, if there is exactly one input lifetime parameter, that lifetime is assigned to all output lifetime parameters: `fn foo<'a>(x: &'a i32) -> &'a i32`.
3. The third rule is that, if there are multiple input lifetime parameters, but one of them is `&self` or `&mut self` because this is a method, the lifetime of `self` is assigned to all output lifetime parameters. 

If the compiler gets to the end of the three rules and there are still references for which it canâ€™t figure out lifetimes, the compiler will stop with an error.

```rust
fn first_word(s: &str) -> &str { // 1
```

```rust
fn first_word<'a>(s: &'a str) -> &'a str { // 1 & 1(rules)
```

```rust
fn longest<'a, 'b>(x: &'a str, &'b str) -> &str { // gives error,as we we can't figure out return type lifetime
```

## static lifetimes
- static lifetimes can live for the entire duration of the program.
- All string literals have the `'static` lifetime
    ```rust
    let s: &'static str = "I have a static lifetime.";
    ```
